# My-Profile-Page

## **What?**
This is a profile page created using HTML and CSS for the second week challenge, which was to create a responsive webpage containing our own personal profile.

## **Why?**
The motivation behind creating this page was to build a site to showcase the HTML and CSS which I have learnt so far on the course, with a particular focus on Flexbox and Grid this week. 

## **How?**
With the acceptance criteria at the forefront of my mind, the steps I took to build my portfolio site were as follows.

I wrote the HTML structure of the page first, choosing to include my contact information, a recent image of myself, a section with some basic information about me, and an image gallery acting as links to some recent work (although these are placeholders).

I used CSS to style the page, choosing brand colours to my own taste, as well as fonts and images which I felt best represented me.

The links on the page all needed to correspond to the correct section or page, so I ensured that this was the case.

I employed CSS Grid to display some images of 'recent work', and all of these images contain titles for the projects. I created a grid layout which displayed the first image to be larger than the subsequent images, and all of the links take the user to another page which will eventually contain a corresponding project.

Lastly, I added media queries to ensure that the grid gallery would respond to the size of the user's device and would display the images to suit each screen size.

## **Result:**
The website looks like this:

It has responsive elements, and meets each of the criteria laid out in the brief.

## **What did we learn?**
This project really helped to re-enforce the knowledge I gained on the use of Flexbox and Grid, as well as enabling me to implement my own media queries and see them in action. I particularly enjoyed tweaking the image gallery layout, and found it especially satisfying seeing it respond to different viewports.
